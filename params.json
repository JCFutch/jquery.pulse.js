JQuery offers plenty in the way of simple effects but this was written\r\nto automate successive, identical transitions and the return to the original state.\r\n\r\nThis is a very light amount of code and unless something drastic changes to the core of jQuery.animate then\r\nit should be future proof for quite some time. It should be as cross browser compatible as jquery is and the\r\nexamples on this page have been tested on multiple browsers, OSes, and devices.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://jarrodoverson.com/static/demos/jquery.pulse.html\">Demo / Examples</a>\r\n=====================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Jarrod Overson\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n    * The names of its contributors may not be used to endorse or promote products\r\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
